# Arduino-Clock
A clock that also reads temperature and humidity, that are being shown on a display, made with an arduino uno

It uses a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, a RTC_DS3231 clock module for keeping track reliably of the time, a liquid crystal display as the output and it also plays a simple song with a buzzer and it has an rgb light bulb that is just for estetics. The case is 3D printed and I used a couple of screws and nuts to hold everything in place. The lid is just a piece of matte plastic that difuses the light of the bulb.
